<p>Welcome to my quiz, this is a quiz in which the user has 60 seconds to complete. The Quiz is a total of 10 questions and each correct answer adds 10 points to the score, if the user either runs out of time or completes all 10 questions they are given a final score and prompted to imput thier initials and it will save to local storage. They are then pushed back to the start screen and allowed to check the leaderboard and see thier score. In the future I would like to learn how to add responsive pictures as well that go along with the questions due to time not wanting to run out of time I had to stick to just words.</p>

<p>PROBLEM : On VS code my quiz is working perfectly fine and when you save your score it returns back to the home page, however i cannot figure out why when its uploaded to GitHub it says that the file path is broken(pictues below)</p>

<p>This is what im returned to on my local browser when i save my score: </p>
